 <p> Women today are more interested in entrepreneurship than ever before. One study found that women are launching, on average, 1,200 new businesses each day. That is the good news. The not so good news is that many of these women don’t have the basic tech skills, including the ability to code, that can help them get ahead. From simple website construction to more in-depth app development, the more a founder knows about technology, the better her chances of success.

My experience as an entrepreneur is a perfect example of the challenges that arise from a lack of coding knowledge. About a year and a half ago, my team at GoHero and I knew it was time to hire a strong head of engineering. We searched and searched, but after a month of interviewing about ten candidates each day, we still had not found the right person to fill the role. So, like any entrepreneur, I came up with a plan—I would learn to code and build a working prototype of our product myself. </p>
